            <div class="p1">
                <p>I am an educator, researcher and GIS enthusiast with a Bachelor's degree from the University of Arizona in Environmental Studies, and a Master's degree from Northern Arizona University in Sustainable Communities. I specialized water sustainability in desert communities at the U of A and gained an appreciation for how to use computer programs to do GIS mapping. During graduate school I 
                        specialized in urban planning and water resources. As part of my master's thesis I created alternative water curricular resources for schools and communities. I am in the process of completing a coding certificate at the University of Arizona where I am learning the elements of full stack development.</p>

                    <p>In 2015 I was invited by Northern Arizona University to participate in the 107th Arizona Town Hall: Keeping Arizona's Water Glass Full. I was a representative of NAU and was able to meet with senators, lawmakers, and other Arizona water stakeholders and present NAU's position. 
                            I have also been published in "Sedona Eccentrics World" magazine writing about water conservation. In the summer of 2015 I had the privilege of studying urban planning in Sienna, Italy. It was there that I had the unique opportunity to GIS map Sienna's intircate underground water aqueducts.

                                I have worked in schools over the past four years. As part of my teaching I have started two different aquaponics clubs. I helped students plan, build, and maintain aquaponics systems in two different schools.  </p>
